జగడపు జనవుల జాజర |
సగివల మంచపు జాజర ||

**Word by word**:
జగడపు jagadapu = of fights; 
జనవుల chanavulu =affection; 
జాజర jaajara = enactment/maya/illusion |
సగినల saginala= squeaks from dolls; 
మంచపు manchapu = of the cot/platform; 
జాజర jaajara = play/ enactment ||

**Meaning**:
of fights of affection is this enactment/play
squeaking platform is this enactment

**Notes**:
Annamayya describes "jaajara" as acts of teasing and play. Referring to that Annamayya says that this game/ play is an enactment of affectionate fights that causes squeaking of cots :). In all, the whole play and the commotion surrounding it seems pretentious/ enactment, hence the word "jaajara" has a tinge of negativity, according to me.

Discussion:
Jasmines tied down the hair-bun with their heavy weight. Amidst jasmine-like elegance and exultation of the bride, the pollen from the flowers fell on the husband. Taking this chance/cue, the women threw pollen/flowers on the cautious husband/groom as a play.

Meaning:
on the Heavy bosom exterior, great
embellishment was spread by sandal powder
on close/near husband/Lord sprinkled, the women
as gifts scattered (more powder), as play
Discussion:
As sandal powder on the exterior of the bosom spread beauty for the lady/bride. Some powder sprinkled on the nearby groom. Noticing that, the women as play scattered more sandal powder on the husband/groom as if it were a gift from the bride's maternal home.
"Saare" is a cultural ritual where in the bride's maternal home send gifts (usually food items).
I am not completely sure I understand the first two lines, honestly. I suspect Annamayya is probably referring to a ritual prevalent at that time, in which the bosom of a woman is embellished with sandal powder OR it could be an indirect reference to sandal powder that has sprinkled from either the chin-throat region where sandal paste is applied to women.  I would appreciate if a knowledgeable person can explain this more clearly.
