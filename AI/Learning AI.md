    - **Week 17-20+:** Build end-to-end NLP applications, such as automated content generation, conversational AI systems, or document understanding systems.

  

    - Collaborate on open-source NLP projects or contribute to research by experimenting with novel ideas in language modeling.

  

    - Deploy language models into production, focusing on scaling, inference speed, and model serving.

  

2. **Stay Updated and Engage with the Community:**

  

    - Regularly read research papers from conferences like ACL, EMNLP, and NeurIPS to stay updated with the latest advancements.

  

    - Join NLP communities on platforms like GitHub, Stack Overflow, or specialized forums to share knowledge, get feedback, and learn from others.

  

3. **Specialization:**

  

    - Depending on your interests, specialize in areas like conversational AI, question-answering systems, text generation, or domain-specific NLP applications.

  

### Continuous Learning
